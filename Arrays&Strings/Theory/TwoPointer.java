         * It involves using two pointers (usually represented as indices) to traverse a
         * collection, often in a linear manner.
         * 
         * ======= Key Concepts:
         * 1. Two Pointers: we maintain two pointers. These pointers move based on the
         * problem's conditions.
         * 
         * 2.Increment and Decrement: The pointers typically move in a systematic way
         *
